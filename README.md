A reflection of this short project on multimedia elements.
The project is about a specific type of weaver bird known as Red-billed Quelea.I have incorporated several multimedia elements which include images, video and audio.
The first image provides a visual of how a male breeding Red-billed Quelea looks like, the second one shows how
a female non-breeding looks like and the third show the specific bird in a swarm of same species.
The audio gives an idea of the sound this bird makes while the video shows that type of bird in a bush.
I have also embedded a YouTube video which helps identify the bird as the most wild animal through its unique features and characteristics compared to other animals. 
The multimedia elements enhance ones understanding of the bird.

I encountered a challenge when embeding the Youtube video since I had wrongly copied the link to it. Upon researching, I came across a possile solution which indeed was viable.
